# Hello, I'm Justin.

**Full Stack Developer** based in Calgary, AB, Canada.

I'm a recent Software Development graduate from SAIT with a passion for building scalable, intuitive applications that elevate user experiences across web and mobile platforms.  I bring both technical depth and creative vision to every project - whether it's streamlining backend performance, crafting accessible UI/UX, or integrating robust APIs.

I thrive in agile, collaborative environments where cross-functional teamwork drives innovation.  I approach challenges with curiosity, precision, and a growth mindset.
